## Skin Cancer Classification - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify skin cancer images as malignant or benign. 

### Project Overview

* **Goal:** Develop a CNN model to accurately classify skin cancer images.
* **Data:** Used a dataset of skin cancer images from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). (Replace with specific dataset details if available)
* **Model:** Implemented a CNN architecture with convolutional and dense layers.
* **Evaluation:** Trained the model on a portion of the data and evaluated its performance on unseen images.

### Technical Details

* **Libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib
* **Preprocessing:** Rescaled images, applied random shearing/zooming/flipping (training only).
* **Model Architecture:**
    * Sequential CNN with convolutional and pooling layers for feature extraction.
    * Dense layers for classification.
* **Training:** Used Adam optimizer, binary cross-entropy loss, and accuracy metric.

### Results

* Trained the model for X epochs. (Replace with actual number)
* Achieved an accuracy of Y% on the test set. (Replace with actual accuracy)

### Future Improvements

* Explore more advanced CNN architectures (e.g., deeper networks, transfer learning).
* Experiment with different hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size).
* Include data augmentation techniques for a more robust model.
